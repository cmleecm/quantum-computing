Quantum computing tutorial

I am interested in exploring the use of quantum computing for solving AI, combinatorial and optimization problems. In order to do that, I have to first understand the basics of quantum computing. Developing an understanding means being able to explain the details and intricacies of the various quantum computing algorithms, and hence my motivation for setting up this repository.

I have started with the Berstein-Varzirani algorithm, one of the staple quantum computing algorithms. The Berstein-Varzirani algorithm is implemented using the ProjectQ framework. I will work towards adding more algorithms.
